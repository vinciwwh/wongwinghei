  In the era of technology, surveillance is pervasive and takes on diverse
  forms, rendering everything public and transparent. It is within this context
  that the project finds its inspiration, drawing from the intriguing concepts
  of voyeurism and architectural surveillance. The presence of surveillance
  endows the observer with a sense of authority and control over others. The act
  of being under constant watch compels individuals to reflect on their behavior
  and subject it to their personal values and norms, leading to a tendency
  towards more socially accepted behavior. This library represents an
  architectural exploration that challenges the conventional notion of windows
  as mere thresholds between private and public realms. Instead, it reimagines
  windows as powerful tools of surveillance and voyeurism, inviting visitors on
  a captivating journey that delves into the tension created by the act of being
  watched.
