  The proposed architecture thesis explores a novel approach to mitigate
  flooding in coastal areas by integrating landscape elements. The aim is to
  introduce a greater quantity and quality of open and natural spaces within the
  site. The project envisions a market that facilitates a harmonious coexistence
  between humans and the surrounding natural habitats. Key to this design is the
  implementation of floating breakwaters, which not only serve as wave
  mitigators but also provide habitats for marine life. Rather than attempting
  to avoid or block out flooding, the design seeks to adapt to the environment,
  embracing its dynamic nature and fostering a sustainable relationship between
  architecture and the coastal ecosystem.
